## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio! This repository documents my journey through the **Data Analytics with AI** course at **Vyyoma Trainings**.

Here you will find my weekly learning logs, code snippets, and the capstone projects I have completed using Python, Excel, and Power BI. My goal is to showcase my ability to handle data lifecycles—from cleaning and manipulation to visualization and insight generation.
