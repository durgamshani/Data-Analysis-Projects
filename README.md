## 🚀 Key Projects

### 1. 🐍 Amazon Sales Analysis (Python/Pandas)
**Objective:** To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world e-commerce data.
* **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook.
* **Description:** Imported and cleaned raw Amazon sales data. I performed extensive data manipulation to clean string formatting in price columns and handled missing values.
* **Key Insights:** Identified top-selling products, analyzed sales trends over time, and determined the most profitable product categories.

### 2. 📈 Customer Churn Analysis (Excel)
**Objective:** To identify key drivers of customer attrition using a large dataset.
* **Tools:** Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboards).
* **Data Volume:** **10,000 records**.
* **Description:** Imported a complex dataset of 10,000 customer records. I used Pivot Tables to analyze churn against factors like contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.
* **Outcome:** Created an interactive dashboard with dynamic charts that visually communicate *why* customers are leaving.

### 3. ✈️ Customer Booking Analysis (Power BI)
**Objective:** To build a Business Intelligence report for a travel booking dataset.
* **Tools:** Microsoft Power BI (Power Query, DAX, Data Modeling).
* **Data Volume:** **50,000 records**.
* **Description:** Connected to a large-scale dataset containing 50,000 booking records. I built a relational data model and designed a multi-page interactive report.
* **Outcome:** The dashboard visualizes booking trends, sales by country, and flight route popularity, allowing for deep-dive filtering and analysis.
